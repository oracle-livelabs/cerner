# Get started

Generating templated compliance documents is a complex process that involves understanding of various components services, their interactions and the setup.
Though this workshop do not reflect an actual form, however the principles outlined here can be effectively used for this purpose.So, let's get started.

## Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Use OCI Generative AI and OCI DataScience to vectorize clinical trial data
* Embedding and loading data into a vector store like OCI Opensearch
* Implement a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) solution
* Effective prompting to generate query outputs with Cohere chat LLM model
* Structure LLM generated outputs with langchain
* Using a pre-canned template to generate a compliance form

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* Basic familiarity with Generative AI concepts, RAG and Industry
* Some familiarity with OCI Generative AI Services and Tool sets
* Familiarity with Python programming language.
* Basic understanding of large language models (LLM)
* Some familiarity with OCI Opensearch service
* Some familiarity with open source langchain framework
* Familiarity with clinical trial and compliance submission process would be helpful but not required
